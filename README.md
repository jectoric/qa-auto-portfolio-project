# qa-auto-portfolio-project

**qa-auto-portfolio-project** created to check the functionality and appearance of the [Google Transalte](https://translate.google.com/) siteand works on the WebdriverIO automation framework. Autotests check the functionality of the site based on priority. <!--In addition to functional tests, there are also non-functional tests for checking appearance by comparing screenshots (UI Regression Tests)-->

> [!NOTE]
> The project was created to demonstrate my test automation skills, there was no goal to cover all functionality and views of Google Translate
