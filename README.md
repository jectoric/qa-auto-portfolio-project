# qa-auto-portfolio-project

**qa-auto-portfolio-project** created to check the functionality and appearance of the [Google Transalte](https://translate.google.com/) site and works on the WebdriverIO automation framework. Autotests check the functionality of a site on Chrome and Firefox browsers. In addition to functional tests, there are also non-functional tests for checking appearance by comparing screenshots (UI Regression Tests)

> [!NOTE]
> The project was created to demonstrate my test automation skills, there was no goal to cover all functionality and views of Google Translate

## Features 
- Executing autotests separatly by suite name (Smoke or Regression/UI Comparison)
- Running autotests on Chrome and Firefox browsers
- UI Comparison autotests that allows to compare current view with predefined scrennshot 
<!--- Remote autotests run on CircleCI -->

## Demo
- **Autotests run example**
<img src="./google-translate-autotests/demo/demo.gif" width=1000/>
- **UI Comaprison diff screenshot example**

## Structure
- Folder with function test cases `google-translate-autotests/tests/functional-autotests`
- Folder with non-function test cases (UI Comparison) `google-translate-autotests/tests/non-functional-autotests`
- Folder with page objects `google-translate-autotests/page-objects`
- Folder with helpers `google-translate-autotests/helpers`
- Folder with test data (files, images) `google-translate-autotests/data`

## Setup project and run autotests locally ‚öôÔ∏è
### 1. Precondition:
- Installed Chrome browser
- Installed Firefox browser
- Downloaded [Node.js and NPM](https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac)

### 2. Setup project:
- Install node modules using command:
```
npm install
```

### 3. Run tests:
To run **all tests** on **Chrome** or **Firefox** naviagte to the package.json and start script `run-all-test-cases-chrome` or `run-all-test-cases-firefox`. You can use next commands to run tests via terminal:

- Run all tests for **Chrome**
```
wdio run ./wdio.conf_chrome.js
```
- Run all tests for **Firefox**
```
wdio run ./wdio.conf_firefox.js
```

Also you can run only **smoke** or **regression** tests using appropriate package.json scripts or by adding `--suite` to the command. Here are examples:

- Run **Smoke** tests on **Chrome** - script `run-smoke-test-cases-chrome` or command
```
wdio run ./wdio.conf_chrome.js --suite=smoke_tests
```
- Run **Regression** tests on **Firefox** - script `run-regression-test-cases-firefox` or command
```
wdio run ./wdio.conf_firefox.js --suite=regression_tests
```
- Run **UI Comparison** tests for **Chrome** - script `run-ui-comparison-test-cases-chrome` or command
```
wdio run ./wdio.conf_chrome.js --suite=ui_comparison_tests
```

## Built With üõ†
- [TypeScript language](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Used to write automation test cases.
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - For managing project's dependencies, including WebdriverIO and any other libraries required for the automation.
- [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/uk/) - Serves as the core automation framework for the project, enabling the simulation of user interactions and testing scenarios on the web application.
- [Pixelmatch library](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch) - is utilized for visual regression testing. It allows to compare screenshots of your app UI, detecting any unexpected visual differences.
